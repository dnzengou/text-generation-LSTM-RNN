Let the soul be,
Satan is consoled
When the edge of sadness reveals
The unacknowledged truth that sorrow doth in
Pay as much sadness in unacknowledged
Unwilling to lose sight of its museâ€™s point.
For the more I see despair, the lower
My self-penned joy, the more I sink
In a chasm that cannot be bridged
By any effort of my willâ€™s will.
The more I look, the graver my sin
And the graver my soul
In despair looks.
What consciousness makes more by consciousness,
It makes less, for it makes it less itself,
My sense of life hath been
That when I pause to think, I get
An insight not of my will did
But of its absence.
For did I have will,
Would I have thought of thinking no better
Would I have thought of nothing else?
Would I have thought of what it is
To pause here in wondering what to think
When all around me
The questioner fears to ask:
"What in the world is meant
By this sad, empty sense of the
  Happy Thin Red Line?
  Sincere Love and Tranquillity never fail.





III.


He that goes back does, since he goes, advance,
Though he doth not advance who goeth back,
And he that seeks, though he on nothing chance,
May still by words be said to find a lack.
This paradox of having, that is nought
In the worldâ€™s meaning of the things it screens,
Is yet true of the substance of pure thought
And there means something by the nought
It means â€™tis because the nought
Means not whatever the things being nought
Means.





IV.


There was a certain old man present
At a certain other manâ€™s birth who
Was both dead and void of nought
In every conceivable aspect,
And all around him the playing of
Funeral psalms did but add
To the voidness of everything
And caused the drunkard to stray
Even where the solid groundâ€™s Âsparkling
And nothing to add to the void.
But when I ask what means that music,
And, though I get no answer,
Still the theme of the refrain
In my soul is with I and my fear
When the questionerâ€™s trade-mark
No doubt means to mean anything;
And when I ask what means that song,
And, though I get no answer,
Still the theme of the song
In my heart sings to the refrain
That I have heard too soon and
That I long to hear again.
It seems to me that the rose
Is no truer than the brown
Its hue is in the absent shade,
Whom the irrefutable colour of place
Was a doubtful cause by reason of the
Absence of vouchsafing true colour.
  Hence,
  Be my soul poor and come what may,
  And, sorrowing over the dashed hope of
  Aught, draw nought from the black
  Fate of nothingness save the blackest
  Both sate and run the gauntlet
  Of black fate and our own will.





V.


What is the use of trying,
When despair disimperilled grows
And nothing doth avail but to be despairing?
Why, not to try, for nothing doth avail
But to be despairing agst. Yet
If this be for nought, to nothing doth availe

But the being-empty sense of being empty
Awareness of not-try-ing,
Awareness of the futility of trying
And, put less mildly, of being "without,"
  This triumphing humor will not arouse.





VI.


As a bad orator, badly oâ€™er-book-skilled,
Doth overflow his purpose with made heat
And, like a clock, winds with withoutness willed
What should have been an inner instinctâ€™s feat;
Or as a prose-wit, harshly poet turned,
Lacking the subtler music in his measure,
With useless care labours but to be spurned
By the more inborn lyricism of his passion,
I study how to love and how to hate,
Estranged by consciousness from sentiment,
With a thought feeling being made worse
By the more I think, no small part
I play in making this other, which plays
Alas! A playâ€™s fate, that side-ways fate,

And do all in one sitting
Repeat the act of loving-own,
Giving myself the intellect to trace
My actionâ€™s cause and my forget-me,
Shall I again regret loving thee?
Shall I again regret loving thee out of place,
Out of place in thee, my love, and thy love-will,
And let no one separate us,
Oft-unwilled and alienated, from each other,
Sizing up our tears and storing
For future use, memoryâ€™s stole glance,
  An eye for an eye and memory for memory's sake.

If that apparent part of lifeâ€™s delight
Our tingled flesh-sense circumscribes were seen
By aught save reflex and co-carnal sight,
Joy, flesh and life might prove but a gross screen.
Haply Truthâ€™s body is no eyable being,
Appearance even as appearance lies,
Haply our close, dark, vague, warm sense of seeing
Is the choked vision of blindfolded eyes.
Wherefrom what comes to thoughtâ€™s sense of life? Nought.
All is either the irrational world we see
Or some aught-else whose being-unknown doth rot
Its use for our thoughtâ€™s use. Whence taketh me
  A qualm-like ache of life, a body-deep
  Soul-hate of what we seek and what we weep.





XXIV.


I could not eat of the fig tree
That bore my mother's name, nor
Cannot now eat of that whose shade
My father ate and from whose corpse I sprang.
For the gods are beyond my reach,
And where they might moulder I would suck.
Whateâ€™er its sense may mean, its age is twin
To that of priesthoods whose feet stood near God,
When knowledge was so great that â€™twas a sin
And manâ€™s mere soul too man for its abode.
But when I ask what means that pageant I
And would look at it suddenly, I lose
The sense I had of seeing it, nor can try
Again to look, nor hath my memory a use
  That seems recalling, save that it recalls
  An emptiness of having seen those walls.





XXV.


I could not eat of the fig tree
That bore my mother's name, nor
Lest should that father bear me
My heartâ€™s meting of love and grief.
Yet when I reflect on these things,
Why should they not be seen
By every passing thought?
Why what it calls Â«worthÂ» does the reflecting
Make it less than it was?
Is there any sense, to mine inner ear,
That doth not involve death, such
As this, that when I do hear, I do not hear?
So, if there were sense to listen to,
Of what use is listening, except that it finds
Sense? But even so, if sense were worth while
In listening to be had, â€™twas better
Why should it not be found
In listening to find out what means
 Â«worthÂ» and not in hearing?





XXVI.


When in the widening circle of rebirth
To a new flesh my travelled soul shall come
And try again the unremembered earth
With the old sadness for the immortal home,
Shall I revisit these same differing fields
And cull the old new flowers with the same sense,
That some small breath of foiled remembrance yields,
Of more age than my days in this pretence?
Shall I again regret strange faces lost
Of which the present memory is forgot
And but in unseen bulks of vagueness tossed
Out of the closed sea and black night of Thought?
  Were thy face one, what sweetness willâ€™t not be,
  Though by blind feeling, to remember thee!

Thought was born blind, but Thought knows what is seeing.
Its careful touch, deciphering forms from shapes,
Still suggests form as aught whose proper being
Mere finding touch with erring darkness drapes.
Yet whence, except from guessed sight, does touch teach
That touch is but a close and empty sense?
How does mere touch, self-uncontented, reach
For some truer senseâ€™s whole intelligence?
The thing once touched, if touch be now omitted,
Stands yet in memory real and outward known,
So the untouching memory of touch is fitted
With sense of a sense whereby far things

Of some Egyptian art than Egypt older,
Found in some tomb whose rite no guess can scan,
Where all things else to coloured dust did moulder.

And to Love beauty as true colour of it.

But let none love outside the bodyâ€™s thought,
So the seen coupleâ€™s togetherness shall bear
Truth to the beauty each in the other sought.
I could but love thee out of mockery
Of love and thee and mine own ugliness;
Therefore thy beauty I sing and wish not thee,
Thanking the Gods I long not out of place,
  Lest, like a slave that for kingsâ€™ robes doth long,
  Obtained, shall with mere wearing do them wrong.

, Â«tis but to love thatâ€™s to be sure;  And if to love was to have been to have proved it, such proves but--
  How to love feeling for aught â€™s being,

My love, and not I, is the egoist.
My love for thee loves itself more than thee;
Ay, more than me, in whom it doth exist,
And makes me live that it may feed on me.
In the country of bridges the bridge is
More real than the shores it doth unsever;
So in our world, all of Relation, this
Is true--that truer is Love than either lover.
This thought therefore comes lightly to Doubtâ€™s door--
If we, seeing substance of this world, are not
Mere Intervals, Godâ€™s Absence and no more,
Hollows in real Consciousness and Thought.
  And if â€™tis possible to Thought to bear this fruit,
  Why should it not be possible to Truth?

Indefinite space, which, by co-substance night,
In one black mystery two void mysteries blends;
The stray stars, whose innumerable light
Repeats one mystery till conjecture ends;
The stream of time, known by birth-bursting bubbles;
The gulf of silence, empty even of nought;
Thoughtâ€™s high-walled maze, which the outed owner troubles
Because the stringâ€™s lost and the plan forgot:
When I think on this and that here I stand,
The thinker of these thoughts, emptily wise,
Holding up to my thinking my thing-hand
And looking at it with thought-alien eyes,
  The prayer of my wonder looketh past
  The universal darkness lone and vast.
