And Â«men are made all but menÂ» and Â«my love for thee can't begin until thee be at last glorified!Â»
And all this is useless, for joyâ€™s in joyâ€™s in
Enjoying, not in thinking of enjoying.
Its mere thought-mirroring gainst itself doth sin,
By mere reflecting solid life destroying,
  Yet the more thought we take to thought to prove
  It must not think, doth further from joy move.





XVII.


My love, and not I, is the egoist.
My love for thee loves itself more than thee;
Ay, more than me, in whom it doth exist,
And makes me live that it may feed on me.
In the country of bridges the bridge is
More real than the shores it doth unsever;
So in our world, all of Relation, this
Is true--that truer is Love than either lover.
This thought therefore comes lightly to Doubtâ€™s door--
If we, seeing substance of this world, are not
Mere Intervals, Godâ€
====================
And Â«What man without Manâ€™s self could not be both father and son,
  And, by co-substance night, both grandfather and great-grandfather.





XXV.


We are in Fate and Fateâ€™s and do but lack
Outness from soul to know ourselves its dwelling,
And do but compel Fate aside or back
By Fateâ€™s own immanence in the compelling.
We are too far in us from outward truth
To know how much we are not what we are,
And live but in the heat of errorâ€™s youth,
Yet young enough its acting youth to ignore.
The doubleness of mind fails us, to glance
At our exterior presence amid things,
Sizing from otherness our countenance
And seeing our puppet willâ€™s act-acting strings.
  An unknown language speaks in us, which we
  Are at the words of, fronted from reality.





XXVI.


The world is woven all of dream and error
And but one sureness in our truth may lie--
That when we hold to a
====================
And Â«tis sunlessÂ» and Â«there is no sunÂ»;
And yet the very day they wrong truth by
Is of the unseen sunâ€™s effluent essence,
The very words do give themselves the lie,
The very thought of absence comes from presence:
Even so deem we through Good of what is evil.
He speaks of light that speaks of absent light,
And absent god, becoming present devil,
Is still the absent god by essenceâ€™ right.
  The withdrawn cause by being withdrawn doth get
  (Being thereby cause still) the denied effect.

Something in me was born before the stars
And saw the sun begin from far away.
Our yellow, local day on its wont jars,
For it hath communed with an absolute day.
Through my Thoughtâ€™s night, as a worn robeâ€™s heard trail
That I have never seen, I drag this past
That saw the Possible like a dawn grow pale
On the lost night before it, mute and vast.
It dates remoter than Godâ€™s birth can reach,
That had
